3. Obtained layout brief and required assets in the correct format - icons, images
4. Wrote html for all blocks and elements on both views in the requirements.

TODO:

REQUIREMENTS:
Deploy using github pages.

Make repo public.

* * *

GIT
Local branch still always returns up to date when I query it. Ask about that and how I reuse local branch eg cards.

* * *

HTML
Refactor html - theres a lot of containers!!

Make better friends with and add BEM naming when refactoring.

But also, did I read somewhere that we're not touching html after its been written, if we can help it?? Or is that just a goal when we're initially writing it (ie write html so well that it needs not to be changed later)?

* * *

SCSS
Ask about layout file - there's a lot in there that's not layout, but then how are we writing SCSS so it makes sense? How much are we splitting things up for small projects?

After media query, we need to display flex again for using flex on the same elements that we use flex on before the media query? (eg nav element in this project) or am I doing that wrong?
